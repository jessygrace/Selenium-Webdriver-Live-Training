<h2><strong>Introduction to Selenium WebDriver &amp; Comparing with Selenium RC</strong></h2>

<p>Now that you have learned to generate straightforward tests in Selenium IDE, we shall now create better scripts using an innovative tool called Selenium WebDriver Training.</p>

<p><strong>What is Selenium WebDriver?</strong></p>

<p>Selenium&nbsp;WebDriver is a web automation framework that enables you to execute your tests against different browsers, not only Firefox (unlike Selenium IDE).Selenium WebDriver Tutorial&nbsp;additionally enables you to utilize a programming language in making your test scripts (not potential in Selenium IDE).</p>

<ul>
	<li>You can now use conditional processes like if-then-else or switch-case</li>
	<li>You can also perform looping like do-while.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Following programing languages are supported by Selenium WebDriver:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Java</li>
	<li>.Net</li>
	<li>PHP</li>
	<li>Python</li>
	<li>Perl</li>
	<li>Ruby</li>
</ul>

<p>You would not have to know each of them. You just need to be educated in one. Nonetheless, in this tutorial, we shall be using Java with Eclipse as our IDE.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Selenium WebDriver Vs Selenium RC:</strong></u></h3>

<p>Before the advent of Selenium WebDriver Training Online&nbsp;in 2006, there was still another, automation device called Selenium Remote Control. Both WebDriver and Selenium RC have following features:</p>

<ul>
	<li>They both allow one to utilize a programming language in designing your test scripts.</li>
	<li>They both enable one to run your tests against different browsers.</li>
	<li>Just just how do they differ? Let&#39;s discuss the answers.</li>
</ul>

<h3><u><strong>Design:</strong></u></h3>

<p>Selenium WebDriver&#39;s structure is simpler than Selenium RC&#39;s.</p>

<ul>
	<li>It controls the browser from the OS amount</li>
	<li>All you need are your programming language&#39;s IDE (which comprises your Selenium commands) and a browser.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Selenium RC&#39;s design is way more complicated.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>You first have to start another application called Selenium Remote Control (RC) Host before you can start testing</li>
	<li>The Selenium RC Server functions as a &quot;middle man&quot; between your Selenium commands and your browser</li>
	<li>When you begin analyzing, Selenium RC Server &quot;injects&quot; a Java Script program called Selenium Core to the browser.</li>
	<li>Once injected, Selenium Core will start receiving instructions relayed by the RC Server from your evaluation program.</li>
	<li>When the instructions are obtained, Selenium Core will execute them as Javascript commands.</li>
	<li>The browser will mind the directions of Selenium Core, and will relay its response to the RC Server.</li>
	<li>The RC Server will get the reply of the browser after which show the outcomes to you personally.</li>
	<li>RC Server will fetch the next instruction from your own test script to repeat the complete cycle.</li>
</ul>

<h3><u><strong>Speed:</strong></u></h3>

<p>Selenium WebDriver Tutorial Online is quicker than Selenium RC since it speaks straight to the browser uses the browser&#39;s own engine to to regulate it.Selenium RC is slower since it uses a Javascript application called Selenium Core. This Selenium Core is the one that directly controls the browser, perhaps not you.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Real-life Interaction:</strong></u></h3>

<p>Selenium WebDriver Training socializes with page elements in a more realistic way. For example, when you have a handicapped text box on a page you were testing, Selenium WebDriver Tutorial actually cannot input any value in it just as how a real person cannot.Selenium Core, just like other Javascript codes, can obtain handicapped components. Previously, Selenium examiners complain that Selenium Core was able to enter values to some disabled text box in their own tests. Differences in API</p>

<h3><u><strong>API:</strong></u></h3>

<p>Selenium RC&#39;s API is more matured but contains redundancies and frequently confusing orders. For instance, usually, examiners are confused whether to use kind or typeKeys; or whether to use click, mouseDown, or mouseDownAt. Worse, different browsers interpret each of these commands in different ways too!Selenium&nbsp;WebDriver&#39;s API is simpler than Selenium RC&#39;s. It doesn&#39;t include redundant and confusing commands.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Browser Support:</strong></u></h3>

<ul>
	<li>Selenium WebDriver Training can support the headless HtmlUnit browser</li>
	<li>HtmlUnit is termed as &quot;headless&quot; as it is an imperceptible browser - it is GUI-less.</li>
	<li>It is a very fast browser because no time is invested in waiting for page components to load. This hastens your evaluation execution cycles.</li>
	<li>Because it&#39;s invisible to the user, it can simply be managed through automated means.</li>
	<li>Selenium RC cannot support the headless HtmlUnit browser. It requires a real, observable browser to work on.</li>
</ul>

<h3><u><strong>Limitations of Selenium WebDriver:</strong></u></h3>

<ul>
	<li>Selenium WebDriver Tutorial Cannot Easily Support New Browsers</li>
	<li>Remember that Selenium WebDriver Training Online functions on the os-level. Also, recall that different browsers communicate with the OS in other manners.</li>
	<li>If a brand new browser comes out, it might have another process of communicating with the OS as compared to other browsers.</li>
	<li>So, you need to give the Selenium WebDriver Tutorial staff quite a while to determine that new procedure out before they could execute it on the next Selenium WebDriver Training&nbsp;release.</li>
	<li>Nonetheless, it is up to the Selenium WebDriver&#39;s team of software engineers to decide if they need to support the newest browser or not.</li>
	<li>Selenium RC Has Integral Test Result Generator</li>
	<li>Selenium RC automatically generates an htmlfile of test results. The format of the report was preset by RC itself. Have a look at an illustration of this report under.</li>
	<li>Selenium WebDriver Training has&nbsp;no built-in command that automatically creates a Test Results File.</li>
	<li>You would need to rely in your IDE&#39;s output window, or design the report your self using the abilities of your programing language and store it as text, html, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3><u><strong>Overview:</strong></u></h3>

<ol>
	<li>Selenium WebDriver Tutorial is an instrument for testing web apps across different browsers utilizing different programming languages.</li>
	<li>You&#39;re now in a position to make powerful tests because Selenium WebDriver Training Online permits you to work with a <a href="http://seleniumtrainingexperts.com/selenium-training/" target="_blank">programming language</a> of your choice in developing your evaluations.</li>
	<li>Selenium WebDriver Tutorial Online is quicker than Selenium RC because of its simpler architecture.</li>
	<li>Selenium WebDriver Training Online directly talks to the browser while Selenium RC needs the help of the RC Server to be able to do so.</li>
	<li>Selenium WebDriver&#39;s API is more concise than Selenium RC&#39;s.</li>
	<li>Selenium WebDriver Training can support HtmlUnit while Selenium RC cannot.</li>
	<li>The only real drawbacks of Selenium WebDriver are:</li>
	<li>It cannot easily support new browsers, but Selenium RC can.</li>
	<li>It doesn&#39;t have an integrated command for automatic generation of test results.</li>
</ol>
